I'm currently a Research Associate at Imperial College London (Apr 2024 – present). My research stands at the AI & Digital Healthcare, with a specific focus on developing robust, interpretable, and accurate AI systems for biomedical research.

My research insterest focus Fine-grained recognition, data synthesis, biomarker discovery, data harmonisation, and prognosis. I have published 50+ papers (2000+ citation in total) at top journals including NMI, ERJ, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMI, MedIA, etc. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to drop me an email at y.nan20@imperial.ac.uk.
